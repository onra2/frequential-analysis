hello, to build the projet just compile it with javac.

use:

Before opening the program put a txt file with unencrypted text in the directory where the jar is located. When you open the program, you can chose between 3 options.

1) Encrypt
	the program will ask you to put the name of the plain text .txt file in it. Put the name of the file without the extension
	example: plain.txt => plain
	
	The program will execute and will ask you to put a key and name the output file.
	The output file will be located at the same place where the plain text version is located.

2) Decrypt:
	Same as before, put the name of the encrypted file and put the key in it and it will generate a new txt file.

3) Decrypt without key:
	since you already said which file should be processed, it will print a key and then create a decrypted txt file with this found key.
